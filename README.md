R code to generate Figure 5, trees and accuracies.

## Code Layout
### analysis
* meannode.tree : the MCC tree generated from BEAST
* tabel.txt : text file that match tips to locations (states)
* implementation.R : R code for randomly sampling Guinea or Sierra Leone. Generating accuracies and rates.
